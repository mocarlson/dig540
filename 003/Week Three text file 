# Biome Sound Audio File

Biomes have a unique name, location and climate.
One attribute of a biome is the fauna that lives in the biome.
Fauna can be mammals, reptiles, birds but I am limiting the diagram to mammals and reptiles.
Mammals, reptiles (and birds) can be male or female.
Males and females can be differentiated by size and weight.

Biomes contain different sounds.
Biome sounds can be from the fauna or the climate.
Fauna sounds can be specific to males or females
Climate sounds can be from the wind, water or changes in temperature.

What I want to add next is the flora and how that impacts sounds (rain on leaves etc)
